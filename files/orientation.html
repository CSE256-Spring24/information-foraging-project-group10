      <h1>About Orientation</h1>

      <div class="communication-section">
        <h2><strong>Orientation Day</strong></h2>
        <p>This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child and parent(s) an opportunity to
          visit the classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour. It will allow time for the
          child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief overview of what to expect during the school year.
        </p>
        <p>The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either Wednesday or Thursday, see orientation
          schedule). The class is divided in half, attending on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule allows the
          children and teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends on Friday.</p>

      <div class="communication-section">
        <h2><strong>Parking</strong></h2>
        <p>Free parking is available adjacent to the Nursery School. These three, 30-minute spots are typically
          available during the school day. Parking in Zone 3 is only permitted with a Yellow Zone 3 parking pass.
          Parents and visitors wishing to have a longer visit should park in the Millbrook or Snow Way parking garages,
          located off Throop Drive and Snow Way. Visitor parking in these lots is $2.00 for the first two hours. The
          Nursery School will provide validation tickets to parents that park in the garage for special school events.
