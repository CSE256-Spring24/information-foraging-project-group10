    <h1>Classroom Information</h1>
    <p>Our classes focus on social development and learning through play. Each year’s class builds on the previous year’s program in curriculum experiences and activities offered. The classrooms are set up to invite exploration and foster a lifelong love of learning. Our staff is deeply committed to the young child and the importance of early childhood education.</p>

    <div class="class-section">
        <h2><strong>Two’s/Young Three’s:</strong></h2>
        <p>Children must turn 3 by February 1 of that school year. The focus of this class is on social development and learning through play. Separating from parents, learning to take direction, and being nurtured by people outside of immediate family are important milestones for this age. The building of trust and growing peer awareness are enhanced by a safe environment that provides a foundation for learning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="class-section">
        <h2><strong>Three’s/Young Four’s:</strong></h2>
        <p>The emphasis in this class is to encourage further socialization by reinforcing how a child’s choices affect their relationships and environment. There are greater expectations for participation and appropriate play practices. This class fosters independence, creativity, cognitive growth, and motor coordination. Children are introduced to phonemic awareness, patterning, number sequencing with value recognition and following both verbal and visual directions.</p>

    <div class="class-section">
        <h2><strong>Four’s/Young Five’s:</strong></h2>
        <p>The intent of this class is to further support the development of social awareness, emotional intelligence, and Kindergarten readiness skills. Critical thinking, science, sequencing, sorting and classification, matching, number values, phonemic awareness, problem solving, storytelling and following multi-step directions are all incorporated in our curriculum. Children develop their gross and fine motor skills while working in large and small groups. Through play and collaborative group work, children come to appreciate the value of cooperation and contribution. The children are encouraged to take risks, helping them discover how the process of learning is often more valuable than the outcome. Mastering appropriate academic skills and fostering social emotional growth are the cornerstones of this program.</p>

    <div class="class-section">
        <h2><strong>Bear Tracks</strong></h2>
        <p>The Bear Tracks program provides an extension of classroom activities for children who are enrolled in the half-day program. Children who attend Bear Tracks are ready for more than half-day classes but perhaps not full-day schedules.</p>
        <p>Bear Tracks is offered Tuesday through Friday, 9:45 a.m. – 12:30 p.m., for afternoon students and Monday through Friday, 11:45 a.m. – 2:30 p.m., for morning students. Parents may enroll their children for participation in Bear Tracks for any or all days it is offered.</p>
        <p>In addition to free choice, outdoor time and a snack, the daily Bear Tracks schedule includes a special activity. These activities are designed to engage a smaller, multi-age group of children in hands-on learning in a specialized content area, such as art, science, movement or literacy. Bear Trackers, for example, might take a nature hike one day, create an art project the next, or dramatize a story in any particular week.</p>
        <p>The main goal for the Bear Tracks program is to continue the progress children are making in their regular classroom within a varied and creative curriculum. Children must be toilet-trained to enroll in Bear Tracks.</p>
