      <h1>Staff-Parent Communication</h1>
      <p>
        Communication isongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website, and emails
        give you information on current themes, activities, and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or
        emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, observations, and/or
        concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email
        or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.
      </p>

      <h1>Parent Conferences</h1>
      <p>
        Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
        students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
        group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="emphasize">Fall Conference:</span> Informal meetings where teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child, and answer any questions.</li>
        <li><span class="emphasize">Spring Conference:</span> More formal with an assessment form covering all areas of the curriculum, including personal observations, to provide a well-rounded picture of each child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.</li>
